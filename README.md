# Text_To_JSON

# JSON-DYNAMIC

JSON-DYNAMIC is a web application that allows you to configure human-readable text and convert it into JSON format. This project was designed & developed by me using **Javascript & Node.js**. Follow these steps to get started:

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Node.js and npm installed on your system

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio Code.

2. Open the terminal within Visual Studio Code.

3. Navigate to the `JSON-DYNAMIC` directory using the following command:
   ```sh
   cd JSON-DYNAMIC
   npm install
   node server
## Client Side

- When you run this project and open it using Live Server (VS Code Extension) it will open up in your local browser (Google Chrome Recommended) on your local host port 8080.

- You can now find the application running and a form something similar to the below picture will pop up. It allows you to dynamically fill out the form as many times as you like. It's not static perhaps giving you the ability to add content as many times as you like.
- Every input will have its unique id making the application flexible.

- In the top right corner, you can find the admin view where you can constantly review & constantly update the material.

  - **Where can I find the text in JSON format?** The answer to your question is that you can find the text converted to JSON available in the data.json file in your local visual studio.
  - **Is the application running on any particular domain?** The answer is simple No, and the reason is that I am currently working to migrate this project from Javascript to Java enhancing the complexity of this project :coffee:
